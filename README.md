A recommendation scheme section changes according to the clicking percentage of a scheme.

Data sets-

1- Equity% (attached sample layout)- 
70%-100% means equity exposure. 40%-70% means balanced. 0%-40% means debt 
exposure. 
2- Take 10 random scheme names and categorise them as debt, balanced, 
equity.

Sections on webpage- 
1- Recommended scheme 
2- Change scheme 
3- Equity%

Whenever the page is opened, 1 scheme will be shown as recommended based on 
Equity%. That is, if Equity% is at 80%, 1 of the equity scheme will be 
shown as recommended. 
Below recommended, show 2 schemes each of other category.

It mainly focus on mainly 2 flows- 
1- If the user clicks on recommended multiple times, example equity, we 
will now suggest Balanced as he has taken equity multiple times already. 
2- If the user clicks on debt 1st time instead of equity, next 
recommendation can be debt.
